üìà Live Bank Marketing Analytics Dashboard (Streamlit)
‚ú® Project Overview
Welcome to the Live Bank Marketing Analytics Dashboard! This project is a powerful, interactive web application built entirely in Python using Streamlit. It transforms static bank marketing data into a dynamic, "real-time" dashboard, allowing stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and data distributions with zero latency.

This dashboard is designed to simulate a live data feed, making it a perfect showcase for Streamlit's ability to handle and visualize frequently updating data and is powered by the popular Plotly library for rich, interactive charts.

üöÄ Features
Real-Time Data Simulation: The core script runs in a loop, continuously updating the underlying data (age and balance) with random factors to simulate fresh incoming data.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Three top-level metrics dynamically track crucial figures:

‚è≥ Age: Average age of targeted customers.

üíç Married Count: The total count of married individuals in the targeted group.

üí≤ A/C Balance: The average account balance.

Interactive Filters: Use the top-level st.selectbox to filter the entire dashboard instantly by Job Type.

Dynamic Visualizations: Features two interactive Plotly charts that update with every simulated data refresh:

A Density Heatmap visualizing the relationship between updated Age and Marital Status.

A Histogram showing the distribution of the updated Age data.

Detailed Data View: A live-updating st.dataframe displays the raw, filtered, and processed data table.
